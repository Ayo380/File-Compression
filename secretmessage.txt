I see a lot of man let their jealousy creep in
Watch who you eat with, the girls that you sleep with
Watch who you talk with, walk with, speak with
The first to the motives, and last to the meetings
Huh, all I know is how to work bruv
Start off as a worker and that's just how it works bruv
When I was tryna work niggas never tried to turn up
But when it's time to turn up everybody turns up
And I don't know what I was thinking with the tweets about the searches
But when Harry got murdered man was so emotional
Tryna find solutions
I had some good intentions but I guess I couldn't word them
The life's so funny
I got a message saying that the streets don't love me
The streets don't love you
