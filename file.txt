PHIL 102: Proofs
PROOF STRATEGY
1.  Work backward: Check the main connective of the sentence you’re trying to prove. This will often    suggest an overall strategy for the proof. For example:
• To prove a conjunction, you usually need to use ∧ Introduction as the last step. So make a plan for deriving the two conjuncts individually.
• To prove a conditional, you usually need to use → Introduction. So set up the proof by assuming the antecedent and trying to derive the consequent.
• To prove a negation, you might have to use ¬ Introduction. So start by assuming the opposite of the conclusion and trying to derive a contradiction.
2. Work forward: Check the premises and ask what you can do with them. Which rules apply? How can you move the proof forward toward the goal you identified?
3. If you’re totally stuck, try indirect reasoning—assume the negation of the conclusion, or of something else that would be helpful to derive, and try to apply ¬ Elimination.

Practice proofs:
1. ¬𝐴 ⊢ ¬(𝐴 ∧ 𝐵)
2. 𝐹 → 𝐺 ⊢ ¬(𝐹 ∧ ¬𝐺)
3. 𝐴 ∨ 𝐵, 𝐴 ↔ 𝐵 ⊢ 𝐴 ∧ 𝐵
